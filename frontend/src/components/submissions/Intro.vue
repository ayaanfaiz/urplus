      Historical submission analysis, coming soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been running a web scraper to collect all submission data
      (time submitted, price, etc.). In the interest of data analysis
      and visualization, I'm going to create some graphs to
      see how things have changed over time, such as time to complete
      reviews per project, pricing trends, and whatever else I feel like.
      Not that useful of a tool, but interesting!
