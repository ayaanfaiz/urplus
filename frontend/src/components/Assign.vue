        Coming soon! The Remote Assignment app will offer continuous remote submission assigning
        through an intuitive GUI. It will come in the form of a chrome extension popup
        (and ultimately through a mobile app*),
        with the usage being as simple as selecting the desired certified projects to assign
        and toggling a master on/off switch.

        Reach out to me on Slack por favor.
